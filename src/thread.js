      text: "I'm currently in Afghanistan now, and I am able to get some internet time. But I guess it depends on where you go. Alot of places have a MWR and/or USO that have computers/ wifi. Also alot of camps tend to do morale net wifi so here is what I suggest you bring:\r\n\r\nA netbook: Small, compact &amp; cheap, a trifecta for the traveling troop. Even if its trashed after your tour you only lost atmost 300-400 dollars. You can use it to watch movies and listen to music, and when you do get to a place that has wifi now you can jump online and not have to wait for a desktop computer. A couple of the MWR's I have been to on most FOB &amp; COB's have wifi. Also, if the mwr doesn't have wifi but they have morale computers, get nice with the personnel working the MWR and most times they will let you connect your laptop directly yo the switch that is usually behind the counter or in the back room, now you dont have to wait for a computer and the usual 20-30 minute time limit on a computer doesnt apply to you.\r\n\r\nAn external HDD, I suggest a 1 TB: Everyone over here trades movies and music and you need an external HDD to get there stuff. Plus if you get the netbook you need space to put all your pics, movies &amp; music.\r\n\r\nA Pelican 1020 HDD case: This will save ur external HDD from malfunctioning in the field. It will keep it from getting crushed in the field and/or damaged from a fall (I speak from first hand experience).\r\n\r\nI wish you the best of luck and I hope you can atleast browse nested discussions while your here!",

Usually circle jerks are contained with the subreddit known as /r/circlejerk but they have been known to jump to other subreddits in true plasmid fashion.\n\nIn reality \"circle-jerk plasmid\" is a misnomer, but it illustrates the properties of its invasive properties and self-sustaining nature well and has become a highly accepted name in the Hivemind Biology academic world.\n\nNotice how the genesis of a circle jerk starts with an innocuous post from suicide_king that is both relevant, funny, and poignant.  This means that the circle jerk plasmid is now primed to regenesis.  Sipsyrup's comment accelerates the process and the rest is history.\n\nIt is not recommended to intrude upon a circle-jerk for it can be dangerous to interrupt the delicate balance.  Revel in the beauty and elegance of Internet Nature and leave it the way you found it (or join in).",

I sent muffins and cookies, but vacuum packed them so they wouldn't mold if it took a month or two to get to him.\n\nOther general Afghanistan care-package tips: \n\n* Starbucks Via coffee (the cold brew instant) is well received, as well as those tiny bottles of \"Five Hour Energy\" drinks. \n\n* There are a lot of fully prepared meals that can be mailed and eaten cold if necessary (I even found a great Taco Bell meal on the shelf at the grocery store once). Hearty stews are great; it gets cold over there.\n\n* Send dried fruit, nuts, beef jerky -- things that can be stuffed in a pocket and munched on patrol. \n\n* Electronics: A usb thumb drive with lots of storage for trading files of music and videos. A camera for taking pictures (can also be traded with the locals for things his company needs). Nintendo DS with games for keeping busy on downtime.\n\nAlso: Antibacterial wet wipes, sharpie markers, yummy-smelling dryer sheets.\n\nWhen sending a care package to someone you know, ask first to see what they have access to. Lots of the junk food we used to mail over are now available at the DX. For a while, there was even a Burger King at the biggest base over there. Our soldiers are a lot less cut off from the world than they used to be. It's surreal sometimes, seeing those facebook updates about, \"Wow, I almost got blown up by a roadside bomb yesterday! Thank god there aren't Duracell batteries in Afghanistan.\" ",

The story goes that the creature will inject some anaesthetising venom into the exposed skin of its sleeping victim, then feed voraciously, leaving the victim to awaken with a gaping wound. Solifugae, however, do not produce such an anaesthetic, and they do not attack prey larger than themselves unless threatened. Other stories include tales of them leaping into the air, disemboweling camels, screaming, and running alongside moving humvees; all of these tales are false.\n\n[source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solifugae)\n",

After "Mission Accomplished", perhaps the whole reconstruction of those countries should have been handed off to non-military agencies.\n',

I know it's not the OP's fault, but I am not going to buy into the jingoistic cliche that anyone in the service is doing a \"noble\" or \"courageous\" job merely by default.\n\nFurthermore, I think the unconditional respect that soldiers seem to get compounds the problem.  There are plenty of people who get paid to protect and defend people on a daily basis that don't get the same respect, and probably deserve it more because at least their job is more clearly beneficial (i.e. police, firemen, teachers, etc.).   If there were less people willing to enlist, our leaders couldn't move them around like pawns on a chessboard to further their own material interests.  Think about it at least.\n",

Only 1 of them was in a \"combat\" situation during his two tours, and it was 2 children that approached their convoy begging for help; they can't stop because every now and then those kids would have bombs or simply be decoys. \n\nAll of them unequivocally told me while they were over there and when they got back that it was the most boring shit they'd ever done and they  had their wives/girlfriends ship them hundreds of dollars of dvds of TV shows so they could pass the time. Everyone in the unit would get a different show/season of the show and they'd all mix and match. \n\nTl;dr: Even though it's abhorrent that we're over there, most of our soldiers aren't running around shooting people/innocents in the face.
